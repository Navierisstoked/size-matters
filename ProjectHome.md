One day I saw a Lattice Boltzmann code written in MATLAB for the well known "flow in a square cavity" benchmark problem. The source code was very short. I first thought that it is impossible to keep it that short with finite volume or finite element.

But than I wanted to give it a try. The plan is to write open source MATLAB flow solvers with different techniques. But the codes will be written for a single, specific problem. We can try cavity flow, backward facing step flow, vortex shedding behind a cylinder, etc. There can be 2D/3D, laminar/turbulent, etc, versions. We can think about integrating heat transfer. Whatever we want.

The basic rule is that the codes should be short and should be written for a specific problem. I am sure this will be very fun and very educative.
